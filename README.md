# digital-readiness-predictor
In today's fast-paced digital world, assessing a country's readiness for digital transformation is critical for effective policy-making and strategic investments. Traditional methods are manual, slow, and lack predictive power. This project was built to solve that â€” by using machine learning to automatically classify whether a country is **Digitally Ready** or **Not Ready**, based on realistic socio-economic and telecom indicators from 2010 to 2025.

Our goal was to build a **scalable, interpretable, and highly accurate tool** that can:
- Help governments identify digitally lagging regions
- Guide infrastructure rollout decisions (like 5G)
- Support researchers and planners with actionable digital maturity insights

## Project Overview

This project predicts the digital transformation readiness of countries using a synthetic dataset (2010â€“2025) with features like internet penetration, broadband speed, GDP, education level, and digital investment.

### Key Steps:
1. Preprocessing & Labeling using Digital Readiness Score (DRS)
2. Model: Random Forest Classifier
3. Evaluation: Accuracy = 97.5%, F1 Score = 0.9796
4. Top Features: Broadband Speed, Internet Penetration, Mobile Usage
