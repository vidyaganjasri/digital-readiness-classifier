# digital-readiness-classifier
In today's fast-paced digital world, assessing a country's readiness for digital transformation is critical for effective policy-making and strategic investments. Traditional methods are manual and slow. This project was built to solve that — by using machine learning to automatically classify whether a country is **Digitally Ready** or **Not Ready**, based on synthetic data ranging from 2010 to 2025.

Our goal was to build a tool that can:
- Help governments identify digitally lagging regions
- Support researchers and planners with actionable digital maturity insights

## Project Overview

This project classifies the digital transformation readiness of countries using a synthetic dataset (2010–2025) with features like internet penetration, broadband speed, GDP, education level, and digital investment.

### Key Steps:
1. Preprocessing & Labeling using Digital Readiness Score (DRS)
2. Model: Random Forest Classifier
3. Evaluation: Accuracy = 98%
4. Top Feature: Digital Investment
